##Assignment
We have to create a fun and educational quiz game using a client/server
communication structure. The aim is to raise awareness about energy
consumption and show people how to be more energy efficient. To this aim, we need
to learn about some new technologies (Spring and JavaFX) and tools such as
version control with git or collaboration on GitLab.

The grade we are aiming for is an 8/10 and higher if possible.

##Products
At the end we will deliver a fully functional quiz game in the form of a GitHub
repository with source code, as well as video showcase of the game.

For sharing written documents, such as backlog, HCI report and other assignments
during their editing period we use Discord. Anything important is uploaded to
Brightspace in case of assignments and GitLab in case of documents like this
code of conduct. Everything strictly relating to the application will also be on
GitLab in the form of merge requests.

The work submitted should be completed in a serious fashion and in terms of code,
it should compile and adhere to checkstyle rules. Also, the material should be
peer reviewed before submission (code reviews for code, intermediate sharing
and opinions collection for assignments). Juan will upload the final deliverable.

##Planning, Behaviour and Communication
We set internal deadlines for every deliverable and contribution, and intermediate
meetings to make sure progress is being done. These will happen on Thursday
afternoon and if needed also on Saturdays afternoon (depending on workload).

If a group member is not properly contributing (i.e. not respecting the
deadlines or submitting non-serious work), we will give a 3-day ultimatum to
correct this unless this is due to a personal exceptional circumstance
and otherwise we will contact the TA.

In the group, we expect respect and support from each other. To handle
disagreement, we believe that communication is key. Again, we stick to the 3-day
rule and in case the conflict is not solved, go to the TA as last resort. In terms
of people being late to meetings, a delay of less than 30 minutes that happens
only once is considered a forgivable mistake but if the delay is more important or
it becomes repetitive, we repeat the steps taken in case of conflicts.

To communicate we use Discord for both chat and video meetings. Meetings are
documented and notes uploaded to GitLab, and if there are important comments
regarding a specific issue, these are of course also posted on GitLab. In case
there is a pressing/urgent matter that needs immediate solution, we meet in a
study room on campus.

##Meetings
We meet once every 2 to 3 days (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays). The
preparation of course depends on the purpose/agenda of the meeting and on what
issue every team member is working on. We could need to have a look at other
people's contributions, prepare an assignment, or other project-related matters.

Decisions are made by vote (the majority wins). If there is a tie, we flip a coin
for the decision to be taken.

##Expectations and Consequences
As for what we expect from the TA, we value their experience, so we mostly want
to get advice on the content of the application. However, we should probably
also be able to ask one or the other question about design choice. If the TA sees
our collaboration is lacking, we also expect her to comment about it in the next
TA meeting, and suggest 1 or 2 ways on how to improve.

If a team member does not adhere to the agreement, we first find out why. Maybe
the agreement is too hard to keep and we expect too much from each other,
in which case we discuss some possible changes in the next meeting. Otherwise,
we stick once more to the 3-day ultimatum and kindly ask the team member to
change how they are working and if this does not yield results we contact the TA.
In the case of being repetitively or excessively late to a meeting we introduce
the additional sanction of making brownies for the team.

##What makes us a great team
We have a great distribution in terms of the Belbin team roles, so we can support
each other and learn from each other to improve as an entity:
- The team worker is covered by Maarten
- The coordinator is covered by Juan
- The shaper is covered by Juan
- The completer finisher is covered by Tudor, Wiktor and Kayleigh
- The implementer is covered by Ana, Maarten and Wiktor
- The specialist is covered by Tudor, Wiktor and Kayleigh
- The monitor is covered by Ana and Maarten
- The plant is covered by Kayleigh, Ana and Tudor

In fact, the only role we are missing is the resource investigator. For this role,
we need to step out of our comfort zone and work together. Otherwise, we see that
for instance coordinator and shaper (Juan) can be supported by the monitor and
teamworker (Maarten and Ana) in that there is a tradeoff between energy, pressure
and challenge and strategy, cooperation and diplomacy.

On the other front we have plants (Kayleigh, Ana, Tudor) and implementers
(Ana, Maarten, Wiktor) mutually supporting each other since plants are creative
and can provide ideas to the implementers to cover for their inflexibility,
whereas implementers put these into practice and make the project happen.

All in all, the roles are covered nicely and strengths of one role can make
up for the weaknesses in another, and since we get along well we can bring the
best out of each other, thus making the dream team.
